This is a list of songs.

1. Angel
Hey now, call it a split, because you know that you will
Oh, oh, you bite your friends like chocolate
You said, we go where nobody know
With guns hidden under our petticoat
Oh, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no

2. Cesar
Wake up (wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
Hide your scars to fade away the shakeup (hide the scars to fade away the shakeup)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go, creating another fable

3. Dorkas
Your way
I'm tryna understand these days
I need to know if you're feelin' it or I'm wastin' my time
Your way or mine
You spent every second with him, you're takin' what you're givin'
Your mother don't approve of the way that you've been livin'
She says he puts you through it, you shouldn't let him do it
And if there is a voice in your head, don't listen to it

4. Alex
Viento vuelve hacer como ayer (2 veces)
como aquellos días en que yo vivía
junto a mi bohío y la madre mia
como aquel entonces tan sólo era un niño
y en esa pobreza que feliz yo era
viento vuelve hacer como ayer para sentir el comienzo de mi vida,
el comienzo de mi historia
VIENTOOOOOOOO
Y AHORA PARA TODA AMÉRICA EL SUPER RITMO DE GRUPO CELESTE

5. Mariana
I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dream

6. Miguel New Song
Wake up (wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
Hide your scars to fade away the shakeup (hide the scars to fade away the shakeup)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go, creating another fable
